Start with a 3B or 8B model for faster experimentation, then try larger models if you want to compare quality.\n\n### 1.1 Understanding Model Outputs (2 pts)\n\nBefore implementing decoding strategies, you need to understand how to extract and display token probabilities from the model.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Load a text generation model (use one of the quantized models suggested above)\n2. Define a prompt and get the model's output for the next token prediction\n3. Complete the provided `get_top_tokens_with_probs()` function to:\n   - Extract logits from model output\n   - Convert logits to probabilities using softmax\n   - Return the top-k tokens with their probabilities\n4. Create a visualization showing the probability distribution\n5. Answer the analysis questions below\n\n**Hints:**\n- Review Section 6 in the lesson for similar examples\n- Use `torch.softmax()` to convert logits to probabilities\n- Use `torch.topk()` to get the top tokens\n- Probabilities should sum to approximately 1.0"

The actual locations depend on your environment:\n\n| Variable | CoCalc Home Server | Compute Server |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|\n| `MODELS_PATH` | `Homework_11_Models/` | `Homework_11_Models/` *(synced)* |\n| `DATA_PATH` | `~/home_workspace/data/` | `~/cs_workspace/data/` *(local)* |\n| `CACHE_PATH` | `~/home_workspace/downloads/` | `~/cs_workspace/downloads/` *(local)* |\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- On **Compute Servers**: Only `MODELS_PATH` syncs back to CoCalc (~10GB limit). Data and cache stay local (~50GB).\n- On **CoCalc Home**: Everything syncs and counts against the ~10GB limit.\n- **Storage_Cleanup.ipynb** (in this folder) helps free synced space when needed.\n\n**Tip:** Always write `MODELS_PATH / 'model.pt'` — never hardcode paths like `'Homework_11_Models/model.pt'`.",
