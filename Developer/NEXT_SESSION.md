### 2. Review Homework 11 v2 Assignment
**Location:** `Homework/Homework_11_v2/Homework_11_Assignment_v2.ipynb`

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Reading questions: Are they appropriate for Chapter 5 content?
- [ ] Part 1 (Decoding): Is the task clear and achievable?
- [ ] Part 2 (API Helpers): Will students understand the requirements?

- [ ] Part 4 (Creative Application): Are the three options clear?
- [ ] Part 5 (Analysis): Are the questions thought-provoking?
- [ ] Part 6 (Reflection): Standard format verified?

### 3. Decide on Solutions and Testing
**Two options:**

**Option A: Create Full Solutions**

- Include complete working code for all 6 parts
- Test on compute server with 48GB GPU (70B models)
- Verify API calls work with OpenRouter

**Option B: Defer Solutions**

## üìã Files Created This Session

- `Lessons/Lesson_11_Text_Generation_v2/L11_0_Overview.ipynb` (updated)
- `Lessons/Lesson_11_Text_Generation_v2/L11_1_Text_Generation.ipynb` (major updates)
- `Lessons/Lesson_11_Text_Generation_v2/L11_2_Background_Supplement.ipynb` (new)

## üí° Key Design Decisions Made

### Content Condensation Strategy
**Problem:** Original lesson was very long with extensive background material.

**Solution:**
1. Condensed pre-2017 history in Section 1 to 2 paragraphs
2. Moved detailed training pipeline to supplement (Section 4 ‚Üí brief overview)
3. Moved RAG and fine-tuning details to supplement (Section 8 ‚Üí brief overview)
4. Created L11_2_Background_Supplement.ipynb for students wanting deeper knowledge

**Rationale:** Focus on practical skills (decoding, APIs, models) over historical/theoretical detail.

### API Content Addition
**What was added:**
- Environment variable management and API key security
- OpenRouter as multi-provider gateway
- Complete code example for building custom API helper function
- Brief LangChain mention (no deep dive)

**Rationale:** Students need practical API skills; these are more immediately useful than deep training knowledge.

### Model Size Progression
**Models demonstrated:**
- 3B: Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct (4-bit, ~2GB VRAM)
- 8B: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (4-bit, ~5GB VRAM)
- 70B: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (4-bit, ~35GB VRAM)

**Rationale:** Show full spectrum from fast/lightweight to slow/accurate. 70B fits on RTX A6000 (48GB).

### Homework Structure
**Reading Questions:** Based directly on NLPWT Chapter 5 (follows established pattern from HW 7-10)

**Technical Parts:** Progression from basic to advanced:
1. Compare decoding methods (foundational understanding)
2. Build API helpers (practical coding skill)
3. Compare model sizes (resource trade-offs)
4. Creative application (synthesis and creativity)
5. Analysis (critical thinking)
6. Reflection (metacognition)

## üîç Review Focus Areas

### Content Accuracy
- [ ] Are 2025 model releases accurately represented?
- [ ] Is agentic AI description current and accurate?
- [ ] Are reasoning model capabilities correctly stated?
- [ ] Are code examples syntactically correct?

### Pedagogical Flow
- [ ] Does lesson build logically from concepts to application?
- [ ] Are API examples clear for students new to API usage?
- [ ] Is homework difficulty appropriate for this stage of course?
- [ ] Do learning objectives match actual lesson content?

### Technical Feasibility
- [ ] Can students load 70B models on compute servers?
- [ ] Will API examples work with student OpenRouter credits?
- [ ] Are decoding strategy examples achievable in reasonable time?
- [ ] Is homework workload reasonable (estimate 8-10 hours)?

## üìù Questions for Instructor

### Content Questions:
1. **Agentic AI coverage**: Is the treatment of agentic AI at the right depth? Too much? Too little?
2. **API vs Local balance**: Does Section 5 (APIs) vs Section 7 (local models) strike the right balance?
3. **Background supplement**: Should stubs be expanded now, or leave as optional future work?
4. **70B models**: Are 70B models appropriate for students, or should we stick to 8B maximum?

### Homework Questions:
1. **Creative application options**: Are the 3 options (Story, Dialogue, Style) all equally good?
2. **Reading question difficulty**: Are questions too easy? Too hard?
3. **Point allocation**: Is 10 pts for decoding comparison appropriate, or too much?
4. **Solutions needed**: Should we create full solutions now, or wait until assignment?

### Process Questions:
1. **Should we test Lesson 11 before completing Lesson 10?** (Currently Lesson 10 is incomplete)
2. **Priority**: Finish Lesson 10 first, or test Lesson 11 thoroughly first?
3. **Custom GPT Bundle**: When should we start packaging Lessons 7-12 for Custom GPT?
