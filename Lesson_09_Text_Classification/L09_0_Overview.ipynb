    "## Lesson 9: Text Classification with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "* Fine-tuning transformers for text classification\n",
    "* Tokenization and data preprocessing for NLP tasks\n",
    "* Using the Hugging Face Trainer API for efficient model training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explain the Fine-Tuning Process**: Describe how transformers are fine-tuned for text classification tasks, focusing on modifying specific layers and adjusting model parameters.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Use Tokenization for Classification Tasks**: Use Hugging Face’s `AutoTokenizer` to tokenize and preprocess input text for classification, understanding the effect of different tokenization strategies on model input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-Tune a Transformer Model**: Fine-tune a BERT model (or similar) on a classification dataset, adjusting hyperparameters to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Analyze the model’s accuracy on the validation set, learning to interpret common metrics (accuracy, F1) and assess model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Readings and Videos\n",
    "* Read *Chapter 2: Text Classification* in *Natural Language Processing with Transformers*\n",
    "* **Course Notebooks with Videos**: Open each notebook in the Lesson_09 directory and watch the embedded videos in the recommended order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessments\n",
    "1. Complete the reading quiz in Canvas (10 points).\n",
    "2. Complete the exercises in your homework notebook in CoCalc (40 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fine-Tune a Sentiment Analysis Model**: Guide students to fine-tune a BERT model on a sentiment classification dataset (e.g., IMDb or SST-2). Students can experiment with different learning rates and batch sizes, and document how these changes affect the model’s accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze Tokenization Impact**: Have students tokenize a small dataset using different tokenization methods and analyze their effects on sequence length, truncation, and model performance. This can help students understand the practical impact of tokenization choices on classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Examine Misclassifications**: After fine-tuning a model, have students examine and analyze misclassified examples. They can hypothesize why certain examples were misclassified (e.g., due to ambiguous language or sarcasm) and suggest potential improvements or strategies for addressing these challenges."
