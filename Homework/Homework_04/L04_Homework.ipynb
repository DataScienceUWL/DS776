    "### **Exercise: Understanding Residual Connections**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Objective**\n",
    "- To demonstrate how residual connections can improve the training of very deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dataset**\n",
    "- Use either MNIST or FashionMNIST.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Model Without Residual Connections**\n",
    "   - Create a fully connected network with 10+ layers (e.g., each layer has 256 neurons and ReLU activations).\n",
    "   - Train the model for 10 epochs using a learning rate of 0.001 and SGD/Adam optimizer.\n",
    "   - Evaluate and visualize:\n",
    "     - Training loss over epochs.\n",
    "     - Validation accuracy over epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Expected Outcome:** The model should exhibit difficulty in converging due to vanishing/exploding gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Introduce Residual Connections**\n",
    "   - Modify the network to include residual connections between every two layers (or groups of two layers):\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     x_{l+2} = x_{l+2} + x_l\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     - Ensure the input dimensions of the skip connection match the output dimensions of the layers (use linear layers if necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train the Residual Network**\n",
    "   - Use the same training setup (learning rate, optimizer, and number of epochs) as in Step 1.\n",
    "   - Evaluate and visualize:\n",
    "     - Training loss over epochs.\n",
    "     - Validation accuracy over epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Expected Outcome:** The residual network should converge faster and achieve better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Deliverables**\n",
    "- Plots comparing training loss and validation accuracy for the non-residual and residual networks.\n",
    "- A short explanation of why residual connections improve training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Discussion Points**\n",
    "- What causes the deep network without residual connections to fail? (e.g., vanishing/exploding gradients, difficulty in learning identity mappings)\n",
    "- How do residual connections address these issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
