    "2. **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**\n",

    "   - Originally designed for **machine translation**, but adapted for **summarization**.\n",
    "   - Uses a **brevity penalty** to avoid favoring overly short outputs.\n",
    "   - Often reported with **1-gram to 4-gram precision scores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BERTScore**\n",
    "   - Measures **semantic similarity** between candidate and reference texts using **contextual embeddings** from models like BERT.\n",
    "   - Matches tokens based on their **cosine similarity in embedding space**.\n",
    "   - Effective for **abstractive summarization**, especially when paraphrasing is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **BARTScore**\n",
    "   - Uses **pretrained language models (e.g., BART)** to estimate the **likelihood of a summary given the source text** and vice versa.\n",
    "   - Evaluates summaries using **bidirectional scoring**: Coverage (`P(summary | source)`) and Faithfulness (`P(source | summary)`).\n",

    "### Comparing Specialized Summarization Models (BART, T5, PEGASUS) vs. LLMs (GPT-4, LLaMA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization tasks can be tackled using **specialized encoder-decoder models** like **BART, T5, and PEGASUS**, or **general-purpose decoder-only models** like **GPT-4 and LLaMA**. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **Strengths of Specialized Summarization Models (BART, T5, PEGASUS)**\n",
    "1. **Architectural Efficiency**\n",
    "   - Encoder-decoder models process the entire input once with the encoder before generating the summary, making them *computationally efficient* for summarization.\n",
    "   - In contrast, decoder-only models must repeatedly attend to the entire input during generation, which is particularly costly for long inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tailored Training Objectives**\n",
    "   - These models are pre-trained specifically for text-to-text tasks.\n",
    "     - **BART:** Trained as a denoising autoencoder, making it robust to noisy or incomplete input.\n",
    "     - **T5:** Uses a “text-to-text” framework, making it versatile across various NLP tasks, including summarization.\n",
    "     - **PEGASUS:** Pre-trained to generate summaries by masking entire sentences during training, directly optimizing for abstractive summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Alignment with Summarization Tasks**\n",
    "   - Fine-tuning on summarization datasets (e.g., CNN/Daily Mail, XSum) leads to **high-quality summaries** that are concise and relevant.\n",
    "   - Performance on benchmarks often surpasses general-purpose LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Better Control over Output**\n",
    "   - Easier to enforce structure, conciseness, or adherence to specific formatting requirements.\n",
    "   - Less prone to **hallucinations** or verbose outputs compared to general-purpose LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Domain-Specific Optimization**\n",
    "   - Fine-tuning encoder-decoder models on specialized datasets (e.g., medical or legal texts) produces highly accurate summaries with relevant terminology and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❌ **Weaknesses of Specialized Summarization Models**\n",
    "1. **Limited Generalization**\n",
    "   - Models like BART, T5, and PEGASUS require fine-tuning for specific summarization tasks.\n",
    "   - Struggle with novel domains or tasks without retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Less Effective at Zero-Shot Summarization**\n",
    "   - General-purpose LLMs can perform reasonably well on summarization tasks without fine-tuning, which is challenging for encoder-decoder models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inflexibility**\n",
    "   - Encoder-decoder models are often designed for fixed inputs and outputs, making them less adaptable to creative or open-ended summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **Strengths of LLMs (GPT-4, LLaMA) for Summarization**\n",
    "1. **Generalization Across Tasks**\n",
    "   - Capable of summarization **without fine-tuning** through prompt engineering (e.g., “Summarize the following text...”).\n",
    "   - Strong performance across various domains with minimal adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Few-Shot & Zero-Shot Learning**\n",
    "   - Easily adaptable to new domains or styles through *in-context learning* (providing examples within the prompt).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Versatility**\n",
    "   - Handles a wide range of tasks beyond summarization, making them highly flexible for mixed-use applications.\n",
    "   - Can switch between extractive, abstractive, or creative summarization depending on the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ease of Use**\n",
    "   - No need for specialized training or fine-tuning, making them immediately usable for various summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❌ **Weaknesses of LLMs for Summarization**\n",
    "1. **Inefficiency for Long Texts**\n",
    "   - Decoder-only models process the entire input text during every generation step, resulting in high computational costs for long documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prone to Hallucination**\n",
    "   - Without fine-tuning or careful prompting, LLMs can generate irrelevant or incorrect information, particularly for factual summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Less Structured Output**\n",
    "   - Outputs may be verbose or off-topic unless the prompt is carefully designed to enforce structure and conciseness.\n",
