    "- **Object-Oriented Programming** It helps to have a basic familiarity with classes, inheritance, and methods for finding your way around in PyTorch.  [Real Python has a great tutorial](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) on the basics of OOP with many code examples that you can either read or watch (40 minutes).\n",
    "- **Deep Learning Basics: Introduction and Overview**  Lex Fridman is a well known podcast host for AI and Data Science.  Here he gives an [introductory lecture](https://youtu.be/O5xeyoRL95U?si=SrM7RLWB_iBPMiK4) for MIT's public deep learning class.  Since it was recorded in 2019 it doesn't include the latest on transformer architectures that are driving the current boom in AI (ChatGPT, etc.), it's still a great introduction that discusses many applications of deep learning.  Watch this if you want a good overview.  I also recommend his podcast.\n",
