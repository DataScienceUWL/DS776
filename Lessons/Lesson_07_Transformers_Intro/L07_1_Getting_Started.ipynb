    "## A Tiny History of Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Initially, NLP relied heavily on rule-based systems and statistical methods to understand and generate human language. These early approaches, prominent in the 1980s and 1990s, focused on the syntactic structure of text, using techniques such as n-grams and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to model language. However, these methods struggled with capturing the semantic meaning and context of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of word embeddings in the early 2010s, such as Word2Vec and GloVe, marked a significant advancement in NLP. These embeddings allowed for the representation of words in continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words. This shift enabled more sophisticated models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to process sequences of text and maintain context over longer passages. RNNs, in particular, played a crucial role in tasks like language translation and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of transformers in 2017 revolutionized NLP by addressing the limitations of RNNs. Transformers, introduced with the Attention is All You Need paper, utilize self-attention mechanisms to process entire sequences of text simultaneously, allowing for better handling of long-range dependencies and parallelization. This led to the development of powerful models like BERT, GPT, and T5, which have set new benchmarks in various NLP tasks by providing a deeper semantic understanding of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have almost entirely supplanted previous approaches to NLP because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Superior Performance:** Models like BERT, GPT, T5, and their successors dominate leaderboards on tasks such as text classification, translation, summarization, and question answering.\n",
    "2. **Pretraining and Transfer Learning:** Unlike traditional methods that required training separate models from scratch for different tasks, transformers leverage large-scale pretraining on vast text corpora and fine-tune efficiently on specific tasks.\n",
    "3. **Self-Attention and Contextual Representations:** Transformers provide rich, context-dependent word representations, whereas earlier models like Word2Vec and GloVe generated static embeddings.\n",
    "4. **Scalability and Adaptability:** With advancements in scaling laws, models can achieve better performance just by increasing their size and training data, an advantage that RNNs and classical machine learning approaches lacked.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few areas where older approaches still exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small Datasets & Low Compute Environments:** Logistic regression, SVMs, and Lasso-penalized models often remain competitive when data is limited or when computational efficiency is a concern.\n",
    "2. **Domain-Specific Applications:** Some applications, like biomedical text mining, may still rely on domain-specific feature engineering approaches alongside transformers.\n",
    "3. **Traditional ML for Interpretability:** Some NLP applications in finance, healthcare, and legal fields still favor older methods due to the need for interpretability and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since transformer models for NLP are now so dominant we will focus exclusively on them in this class."

    "## NLP Tasks Instead of Transformer Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers are more complicated than the CNNs we saw for computer vision so we're not going to dive as deeply into the details. We will, in Lesson 9 - Transformer Details, learn about some of the nuts and bolts especially the self-attention mechanism that allows transformers to figure out relationships between words and to understand context. Mostly, though, we will focus on the applications of transformers. To this end we'll dive into the open source HuggingFace ecosystem which hosts thousands of NLP models and datasets and makes it quite simple to dive into NLP applications without having to master too much code. All of the newest, biggest open source transformer models are hosted there including those from Meta, Mistral, and Deepseek. The only thing keeping us from running the biggest state-of-the-art models will be lack of compute, but we can run their smaller cousins on the GPU in CoCalc's compute server, a decent gaming GPU, or even a CPU."

    "## API-based LLMs versus Fine-tuning Specialized Models\n",
    "\n",
    "As large language models (LLMs) continue to improve, their use as general NLP task solvers via prompting is increasingly popular, especially when we don't have access to large amounts of training data. In this course, we'll focus on two main approaches to solving NLP tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using LLMs via APIs** (like GPT-4o, Claude, or Gemini through OpenRouter)\n",
    "2. **Fine-tuning specialized transformer models** for specific tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "*(We'll also explore running LLMs locally in Lesson 11, but for Lessons 7-10 and 12 we'll use API-based models and task-specific fine-tuned models.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For a text-classification task, you could choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM via API (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, etc.)**\n",
    "- When you need **a quick, general-purpose classifier** without training a model\n",
    "- When **zero-shot or few-shot classification** (via prompting) is sufficient\n",
    "- When categories may evolve frequently, making retraining impractical\n",
    "- When you don't have a large labeled dataset\n",
    "- Example: Categorizing support tickets by topic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tune BERT / RoBERTa / DistilBERT**\n",
    "- When you have a **moderate to large labeled dataset** and need **high accuracy**\n",
    "- When you need **fast inference at scale**, as fine-tuned models are more efficient than large LLMs\n",
    "- When your classification task requires **domain-specific adaptation**\n",
    "- When you need **very low latency** or **predictable costs**\n",
    "- Example: Sentiment analysis on customer feedback in a specific industry\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on terminology:** Zero-shot classification means classifying text without seeing any examples - the LLM just gets a prompt with the possible categories. Few-shot classification means providing a small number of examples in the LLM prompt to guide the model's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use API-based LLMs when:**\n",
    "- You need **quick, adaptable solutions** without training infrastructure\n",
    "- You **don't have much labeled data** for fine-tuning\n",
    "- You want to **experiment rapidly** with different task formulations\n",
    "- Task requirements may change frequently\n",
    "- You're prototyping or building proof-of-concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tune a specialized model when:**\n",
    "- You have **domain-specific labeled data** and need **high accuracy**\n",
    "- You need **very fast inference** or processing at large scale\n",
    "- You need **predictable costs** (no per-token API charges)\n",
    "- You require **consistent, structured outputs**\n",
    "- Latency is critical (milliseconds matter)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Data Privacy with API-based LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "A common concern with API-based LLMs is: **\"Will my data be used to train the model?\"** or **\"Is my sensitive data secure?\"** The answer depends on the provider and the agreements in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Privacy Protections Available:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most major LLM providers now offer enterprise-grade privacy protections:\n",
    "- **Zero Data Retention (ZDR):** Your API requests are not stored or logged after processing\n",
    "- **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):** Legal contracts preventing use of your data for model training\n",
    "- **HIPAA and SOC 2 Compliance:** Meeting healthcare and security standards for regulated industries\n",
    "- **Private Deployments:** Dedicated instances in your own cloud environment (e.g., Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock)\n",
    "- **Regional Data Residency:** Keep data within specific geographic boundaries (e.g., EU-only processing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **OpenAI API:** Has a default policy not to use API data for training. Enterprise customers can enable additional protections.\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI Service:** Fully isolated deployments in your Azure subscription with complete data control\n",
    "- **Google Vertex AI:** Private endpoints with data residency controls and enterprise security\n",
    "- **Anthropic Claude:** API data not used for training; enterprise options for additional controls\n",
    "\n",
    "**When API Privacy May Not Be Enough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with these protections, there are situations where API-based solutions may not be acceptable:\n",
    "- **Air-gapped environments:** Systems physically isolated from external networks (e.g., classified government systems)\n",
    "- **Extreme regulatory restrictions:** Some industries may prohibit any external data transmission regardless of agreements\n",
    "- **Zero-trust requirements:** Organizations that cannot accept any third-party processing, even contractually protected\n",
    "- **Competitive intelligence:** Proprietary algorithms or trade secrets that cannot be exposed, even with DPAs\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, running models locally (Lesson 11) or fine-tuning your own specialized models on internal infrastructure becomes necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom Line:** For most educational, research, and business applications, modern API providers offer sufficient privacy protections through contractual agreements and technical controls. Understanding your specific regulatory requirements and risk tolerance will guide your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Approach (with changes for Fall 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each NLP task in Lessons 7-10 and 12, we'll explore both API-based LLM approaches and fine-tuned specialized models. In Lesson 11, we'll dive deeper into text generation and demonstrate running LLMs locally for complete control and privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You may notice some slight differences between the lesson notebooks and some of the recorded videos in the NLP portion of the class.  When the course was developed we ran very small LLMs locally on the compute servers in CoCalc.  It was slow and we were limited to very slow models.  This semester we're providing some credits on OpenRouter to allow you to use various models (even the biggest, newest ones ... but you may need to pay for more credits).  We'll explain more about OpenRouter below.*   "

This means you can experiment with different models using a single API interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your API Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each student has been provided with $15 in OpenRouter API credit.** This should be more than sufficient to complete all coursework if you use small and medium-sized models appropriately. For reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small models** (like `gemini-flash-lite`, `llama-3.2-3b`, `gpt-4o-mini`): Very inexpensive, typically $0.075-0.15 per million input tokens\n",
    "- **Medium models** (like `gemini-flash`, `claude-haiku`): Moderate cost, good quality\n",
    "- **Premium models** (like `gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet`, `o3-mini`): Higher cost, best quality\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using **`gemini-flash-lite`** as your default model for coursework - it's fast, inexpensive, and produces good results for learning tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Checking Your Remaining Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check your remaining OpenRouter credit using the `llm_get_credits()` function from the course package. This will show you how much of your $15 credit remains:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "~/home_workspace/api_keys.env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `config_paths_keys()` in your import cell (as shown below), this API key will be automatically loaded and available for use with `llm_generate()`. You don't need to do anything else!\n",

    "### Exploring Available Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The course package includes 16 carefully curated models covering a range of capabilities and price points. You can see them all with `llm_list_models()`, which we'll demonstrate shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Want to try models beyond our curated list?** OpenRouter provides access to hundreds of models! You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Browse all available models** at: https://openrouter.ai/models\n",
    "2. **Use any model** by providing its full OpenRouter model ID\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to use OpenAI's new GPT-5-nano model (not in our curated list), you would use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = llm_generate('openai/gpt-5-nano', \"Your prompt here\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The full model ID format is typically `provider/model-name` (e.g., `openai/gpt-5-nano`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4.1`, `google/gemini-2.5-pro`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Models outside our curated list won't show pricing or metadata with `llm_list_models()`, but they'll work fine if you provide the correct model ID from the OpenRouter website."

       "Mittens was no ordinary feline. While other cats chased laser pointers and napped in sunbeams, Mittens had a more refined curiosity. Her gaze often drifted to the grand piano in the living room, its polished surface reflecting the world like a dark, silent lake. She’d perch on the edge of the piano bench, her tail twitching with an unspoken longing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her humans, a kindly couple named Arthur and Eleanor, were amateur musicians. Their evenings were often filled with the warm, resonant embrace of music. Mittens would listen, her emerald eyes half-closed, captivated by the cascade of notes. Sometimes, when Arthur played a particularly melancholic piece, she’d let out a soft, questioning meow, as if trying to harmonize with the sorrow.\n",
       "\n",
       "One afternoon, Arthur left the piano lid open. Mittens, bolder than usual, hopped onto the bench. She sniffed at the keys, a strange, foreign scent. Then, tentatively, she extended a paw. A single, clear note, a startling B-flat, echoed in the quiet room. Mittens flinched, her ears swiveling. But the sound, though unexpected, didn't scare her. Instead, it sparked something within.\n",
       "\n",
       "Over the next few weeks, Mittens’ secret practice sessions became a nightly ritual. She’d wait until Arthur and Eleanor were asleep, then pad silently into the living room. Her initial attempts were clumsy. Paws would land haphazardly, producing jarring chords. She’d bat at the keys, a flurry of random sounds. But with each attempt, she grew more deliberate. She discovered that gently pressing a key produced a softer tone, and a firmer press a louder one. Her tail would swish rhythmically, as if conducting her own silent orchestra.\n",
       "\n",
       "She began to associate certain keys with specific feelings. A low rumble from the bass clef felt like a contented purr. Higher, tinkling notes reminded her of the jingle of her toy mice. She even started to mimic the melodies she’d heard her humans play, albeit in a simplified, feline interpretation. Her “Für Elise” was a series of hesitant, yet recognizable, arpeggios. Her “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” was a whimsical, slightly off-key rendition.\n",
       "\n",
