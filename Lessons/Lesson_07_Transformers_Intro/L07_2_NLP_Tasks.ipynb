    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll demonstrate solutions to some common Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks that use transformer models.  We expand on the material in our NLP textbook Chapter 1 - Hello Transformers.  We'll add a little background about the underlying models.  We'll also demonstrate how these same tasks come be done using a large language model with either \"zero-shot prompting\" or \"few-shot prompting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next five lessons we'll go into some of these NLP tasks in detail and a learn a bit about the transformer neural network architecture.  For each of the NLP tasks that follows we'll demonstrate how to do the task two ways.  The first is by using a pre-trained transformer-based model downloaded from HuggingFace.  In the second approach we'll use a a large language model and prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LLMs for various NLP tasks is common when there isn't much labeled data available.  Zero-shot prompting means that no examples are provided to the LLM.  Few-shot prompting means that a small number of examples are provided to the LLM.  In this notebook we'll demonstrate zero-shot prompting, but in the lessons to come we'll include few-shot prompting examples.\n",

It involves analyzing the content of the text and categorizing it based on its subject, sentiment, or other criteria. One common application of text classification is sentiment analysis, which determines the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is widely used in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research to gauge public opinion and customer satisfaction.\n",

    "In this case, a \"BERT\" model correctly classified the customer feedback as negative. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model developed by Google. It is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. This allows BERT to understand the context of a word based on its surroundings, making it highly effective for various NLP tasks. The particular model used here is a distilled BERT model that has been fine-tuned on a sentiment dataset. A distilled model is a smaller, faster, and more efficient version of a larger model, trained using knowledge distillation, where the smaller model learns to mimic the outputs of the larger one while retaining most of its performance. In Lesson 9, we'll learn more about the family of transformer models called encoders, which include BERT models."

QA systems can be designed to answer questions based on a given context or a large corpus of documents. The goal is to provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries.\n",

    "- **Customer Support**: Providing instant answers to customer queries based on a knowledge base or FAQ, improving response times and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "- **Education**: Assisting students by answering questions related to their coursework or providing explanations for complex topics.\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Offering medical professionals quick access to information from medical literature or patient records to support clinical decision-making.\n",
    "- **Search Engines**: Enhancing search results by directly providing answers to user queries, rather than just a list of relevant documents.\n",
