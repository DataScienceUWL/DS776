We expand on the material in our NLP textbook Chapter 1 - Hello Transformers.  We'll add a little background about the underlying models.

It involves analyzing the content of the text and categorizing it based on its subject, sentiment, or other criteria. One common application of text classification is sentiment analysis, which determines the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is widely used in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research to gauge public opinion and customer satisfaction.\n",

    "In this case, a \"BERT\" model correctly classified the customer feedback as negative. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model developed by Google. It is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. This allows BERT to understand the context of a word based on its surroundings, making it highly effective for various NLP tasks. The particular model used here is a distilled BERT model that has been fine-tuned on a sentiment dataset. A distilled model is a smaller, faster, and more efficient version of a larger model, trained using knowledge distillation, where the smaller model learns to mimic the outputs of the larger one while retaining most of its performance. In Lesson 9, we'll learn more about the family of transformer models called encoders, which include BERT models."
