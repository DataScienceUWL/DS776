    "   - `\"unsloth/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-bnb-4bit\"` - Alternative 3B option\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Medium models (7-8B parameters, ~5-6GB VRAM):**\n",
    "   - `\"unsloth/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-bnb-4bit\"` - Balanced quality/speed\n",
    "   - `\"unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-bnb-4bit\"` - Base 8B variant\n",

    "\n",
    "### Option A: Story Continuation System\n",
    "- Create a system that takes a story opening and generates multiple continuations using different decoding strategies\n",
    "- Allow the user to select which continuation they prefer\n",
    "- Continue the story iteratively, building on the selected continuations\n",
    "- Generate at least 3 rounds of story development\n",

    "### Option B: Dialogue Generator\n",
    "- Create a multi-character dialogue system\n",
    "- Define personalities for 2-3 characters (via system prompts)\n",
    "- Generate a conversation between the characters on a given topic\n",
    "- Experiment with different decoding parameters for each character to reflect their personality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option C: Writing Style Transformer\n",
    "- Take a piece of text and rewrite it in different styles (formal, casual, poetic, technical, etc.)\n",
    "- Use both local models and API-based models\n",
    "- Compare how different models handle style transformation\n",
    "- Test with at least 3 different input texts and 4 different target styles\n",
