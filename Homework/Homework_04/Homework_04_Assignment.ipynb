The point isn't really to get the best classifier possible, rather we want you to get some experience seeing how deep networks can be difficult to train and how using batch normalization and residual connections can make a network easier to train while also increasing the performance.  Along the way you'll practice building a deep model using loops instead of typing out each individual layer.\n\n\n## Part 1 - Deep Fully Connected Network (8 pts)\n\nOur network will consist of:\n* input layer which maps the flattened 784 pixels to 64 neurons followed by a ReLU function.\n* 10 blocks, each block has linear + ReLU + linear + ReLU, the number of neurons stays at 64\n* a linear output layer that maps the 64 neurons to 10 output neurons (for 10 classes) \n\nUse this template (cut and paste into a code cell and complete the model)\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass SimpleBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_dim=64):\n        super(SimpleBlock, self).__init__()\n        # fill in the repeating elements here linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim) + ReLU + linear + ReLU\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # fill the forward methods to call linear + ReLU + linear + ReLU and return result\n        return # complete\n\nclass Deep_MNIST_FC(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_blocks=10):\n        super(Deep_MNIST_FC, self).__init__()\n        \n        # Input layer\n        self.input_layer = ### complete the input layer with linear and ReLU, will handle flatten in the forward below\n    \n        \n        # Repeating simple blocks\n        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(*[SimpleBlock(64) for _ in range(num_blocks)])\n        \n        # Output layer\n        self.output_layer = ### add output layer\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten input\n        ## call input layer\n        ## call blocks\n        ## call output layer\n        return x\n```"

The actual locations depend on your environment:\n\n| Variable | CoCalc Home Server | Compute Server |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|\n| `MODELS_PATH` | `Homework_04_Models/` | `Homework_04_Models/` *(synced)* |\n| `DATA_PATH` | `~/home_workspace/data/` | `~/cs_workspace/data/` *(local)* |\n| `CACHE_PATH` | `~/home_workspace/downloads/` | `~/cs_workspace/downloads/` *(local)* |\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- On **Compute Servers**: Only `MODELS_PATH` syncs back to CoCalc (~10GB limit). Data and cache stay local (~50GB).\n- On **CoCalc Home**: Everything syncs and counts against the ~10GB limit.\n- **Storage_Cleanup.ipynb** (in this folder) helps free synced space when needed.\n\n**Tip:** Always write `MODELS_PATH / 'model.pt'` — never hardcode paths like `'Homework_04_Models/model.pt'`.",
