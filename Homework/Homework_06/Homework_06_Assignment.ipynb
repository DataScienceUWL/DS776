   "source": "## Part 2 - YOLO v11 Pedestrian Detection (18 pts)\n\nYOLO (You Only Look Once) models are a family of object detection models known for their speed and accuracy. Unlike traditional object detection methods that use a sliding window approach, YOLO models frame object detection as a single regression problem, directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from full images in one evaluation. This makes YOLO models extremely fast, making them suitable for real-time applications.\n\nYOLO models consist of a single convolutional network that simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. The architecture is divided into several key components:\n\n1. **Backbone**: This is typically a convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracts essential features from the input image.\n2. **Neck**: This part of the network aggregates and combines features from different stages of the backbone. It often includes components like Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) or Path Aggregation Networks (PAN).\n3. **Head**: The final part of the network, which predicts the bounding boxes, objectness scores, and class probabilities. It usually consists of convolutional layers that output the final detection results.\n\nYOLO models are quite easy to load and train because they provide pre-trained weights and a straightforward API for customization and fine-tuning. The hardest part may be preparing the data in the format that the API expects, but we've done that for you.\n\nRun the cell below once to prepare the Penn Fudan Pedestrian dataset in YOLO format. This dataset uses the same splits we used in the lesson to allow you to compare the results to the Faster R-CNN model we trained there."
