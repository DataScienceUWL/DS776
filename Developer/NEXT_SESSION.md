### ‚ö†Ô∏è Push Status: AUTHENTICATION ISSUE
**Error:** `remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported`

**To fix:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use SSH instead of HTTPS
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DataScienceUWL/DS776.git

# Option 2: Configure personal access token
git config credential.helper store
# Then on next push, enter personal access token instead of password

# Option 3: Use GitHub CLI
gh auth login
```

**After fixing auth, push with:**
```bash
git push origin main
```

## üéì Pedagogical Rationale

### Why Class-Based Approach?

**Professional Standards:**
- Real-world SDKs use classes (OpenAI SDK, Anthropic SDK, LangChain)
- Demonstrates production-quality software engineering
- Prepares students for industry practices

**Learning Benefits:**
- **OOP Concepts:** Concrete examples of encapsulation, inheritance, extensibility
- **Design Patterns:** Shows how to design clean, maintainable APIs
- **Reusability:** DRY principle in action (configure once, use many times)
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add features via subclasses

**Comparison Opportunity:**
- Students can compare function-based vs class-based
- Understand trade-offs and when to use each approach
- Homework Task 2d specifically asks for this comparison

### Why OpenRouter?

**Practical:**
- Single API key for multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta)
- Generous free tier for testing
- OpenAI-compatible (same interface as OpenAI API)

**Educational:**
- Easy model comparison across providers
- Transparent cost information
- Real-world application (many startups use OpenRouter)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### None Currently
All phases completed successfully. Reorganization scripts worked as expected.

### Potential Issues to Monitor:
1. **API Keys:** Students need OpenRouter API keys (provide instructions)
2. **Rate Limits:** Free tier has limits (document in homework)
3. **Model Availability:** Some models may be removed from OpenRouter (check periodically)

---

## üìö Key Design Decisions

### 1. Section Organization
- Decoding strategies (Section 5) BEFORE APIs (Section 6-7)
  - Rationale: Learn mechanics with local models, then apply to APIs
  - Students understand what decoding parameters actually do

### 2. Class-Based API Approach
- LLMClient for single-turn, ChatbotClient extends for multi-turn
  - Rationale: Natural progression, demonstrates inheritance clearly
  - More maintainable than function-based approach

### 3. Early API Context (Section 1)
- Explain APIs upfront, then teach HuggingFace mechanics
  - Rationale: Students understand "why learn this if we use APIs?"
  - Justifies the pedagogical approach

### 4. Section 8 (Decoding with Local/API) After Section 7
- Shows practical application of both local and API models
  - Rationale: Students see how decoding works in both contexts
  - Demonstrates 70B models (larger scale)

### 5. No Supplement Notebook
- All content in main lesson notebook
  - Rationale: User explicitly requested this
  - Keeps everything in one place

## üîÑ Migration from v2 to v3

### What Changed:
- **Structure:** 8 sections ‚Üí 9 sections (added Sections 5, 6, 7; renumbered 7‚Üí8, 8‚Üí9)
- **Approach:** Function-based API ‚Üí Class-based API
- **Content:** +20 cells for Sections 6 & 7, -4 duplicate cells
- **Homework:** Part 2 changed from functions to classes

### What Stayed the Same:
- Sections 1-4 content (with additions)
- Decoding strategies theory (Section 5, formerly scattered)
- Section 8 content (formerly Section 7)
- Section 9 content (formerly Section 8, consolidated)
- All other homework parts unchanged

### Backwards Compatibility:
- Students who started with v2 can continue with v2
- v3 is for new cohorts or when updating materials
- Both versions teach the same core concepts
