# Summarize Office Hours Transcript

## Description
Creates a condensed summary of DS776 office hours transcripts, extracting only course-relevant educational content with timestamps while removing names and conversational elements.

## Usage
```
/summarize_transcript <path_to_transcript.md>
```

## Instructions
Please analyze the provided DS776 office hours transcript and create a condensed summary following these specific requirements:

### Content Requirements:
- **Extract ONLY course-relevant educational content**
- **Keep MM:SS timestamps** (minutes:seconds from video start)
- **Remove ALL names** (Jeff Baggett is instructor, others are students)
- **Exclude:** greetings, personal chat, small talk, goodbyes, technical setup discussions, off-topic conversations
- **Include:** technical topics, troubleshooting, concept explanations, homework help, coding issues, architectural discussions

### Output Format:
```markdown
# DS776 Office Hours Summary - [Session Title]

## Topics Covered

**[MM:SS]** Topic description
- Key educational point 1
- Key educational point 2
- Technical solutions or explanations

**[MM:SS]** Next topic
- Key educational point 1
- Solutions or recommendations
```

### Example Output:
```markdown
**[05:31]** Data preparation troubleshooting for Homework 1
- Student stuck on preparing spiral data
- Issue with MakeSpirals function parameter naming (n_samples vs numpoints)

**[09:04]** Network width vs depth explanation using Neural Network Playground
- Wider networks: more neurons per layer, limited to linear combinations
- Deeper networks: more nonlinearity, can represent complex patterns like spirals
- Single layer with many neurons cannot match multi-layer performance

**[27:29]** Train/validation/test data splits clarification
- Three-way split: training, validation, test
- Validation set used during training process for monitoring
- Test set reserved until very end for final performance evaluation

**[33:15]** Activation function details and gradient saturation
- Hyperbolic tangent and sigmoid have flat tails leading to zero gradients
- ReLU avoids saturation but has dead neurons for negative values
- Leaky ReLU addresses dead neuron problem with small negative slope
```

### Processing Steps:
1. **Read the transcript file** from the provided path
2. **Identify educational content** by looking for technical discussions, concept explanations, and problem-solving
3. **Extract timestamps** in MM:SS format from relevant sections
4. **Remove all personal names** and references
5. **Group related discussions** under topic headers
6. **Create bullet points** summarizing key educational points
7. **Save output** as `[original_filename]_Summary.md` in the same directory

### Quality Checks:
- Ensure all timestamps are in MM:SS format
- Verify no names are included in the summary
- Confirm only educational/technical content is preserved
- Check that solutions and explanations are clearly stated
- Maintain chronological order of topics

Please create the summary and save it to the appropriate location.
