## ⚠️ Large PDF Strategy

**Problem:** IDL Chapter 2 PDF (~4.5MB) is too large for context.

**Solution:** Parse chapter PDFs in chunks:
1. Read PDF page by page or section by section
2. Extract key concepts for quiz questions
3. Never try to load entire chapter at once

This applies to any large chapter PDFs.

## 📋 Next Steps (After Questions Answered)

```bash
pip install text-to-qti
mkdir -p Developer/Quizzes
```

### Step 2: Create First Quiz (L01)
1. Read IDL Chapter 1 (focus 1.2, 1.4, 1.5) and Chapter 2
2. Create `Developer/Quizzes/quiz_01.md` with 10 MC questions
3. Test conversion: `text-to-qti convert quiz_01.md -o quiz_01.zip`
4. Test import in Canvas sandbox

### Step 3: Process Lessons in Order
For each lesson (L01 → L12):
1. Create quiz aligned with assigned reading
2. Update homework notebook (remove reading Qs if present, add storage reminder)
3. Address any Spring_2026_updates.md issues for that lesson
4. Commit and push after each lesson complete
