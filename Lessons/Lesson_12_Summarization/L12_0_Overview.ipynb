    "## Lesson 12: Summarization with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "* Extractive vs. abstractive summarization\n",
    "* Transformer models for summarization (e.g., BART, T5)\n",
    "* Evaluation metrics for summarization (e.g., ROUGE scores)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand Summarization Approaches**: Differentiate between extractive and abstractive summarization, identifying the benefits and limitations of each approach.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Fine-Tune a Summarization Model**: Use a transformer model, such as BART or T5, to perform summarization on a dataset, focusing on fine-tuning techniques for high-quality summary generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Summaries**: Apply evaluation metrics like ROUGE to assess the relevance, coherence, and completeness of generated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Discuss Summarization Applications**: Identify practical applications of summarization in fields like news, research, customer service, and document management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Readings and Videos\n",
    "* Read *Chapter 6: Summarization* in *Natural Language Processing with Transformers*\n",
    "* **Course Notebooks with Videos**: Open each notebook in the Lesson_12 directory and watch the embedded videos in the recommended order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessments\n",
    "1. Complete the reading quiz in Canvas (10 points).\n",
    "2. Complete the exercises in your homework notebook in CoCalc (40 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summarize News Articles**: Have students fine-tune a BART or T5 model on a news dataset and generate summaries for a set of articles. They can use ROUGE scores to evaluate summary quality and compare results with the original articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare Extractive and Abstractive Summarization**: Ask students to apply both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques on the same dataset and compare the summaries produced. They should analyze the differences in informativeness, coherence, and relevance between the two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Summarization Performance**: Guide students to test different summary lengths and analyze ROUGE scores to assess summary relevance and completeness. They can experiment with varying degrees of compression to see how the model balances detail and conciseness."
