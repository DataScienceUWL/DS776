    " ## AI Use Policy: Building Deep Learning Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### The Real Goal: Understanding Patterns, Not Just Our Framework\n",
    "  Yes, you probably won't use our exact `train_network` function in your career—you'll likely move to PyTorch Lightning, HuggingFace Trainers, or other frameworks.\n",
    "  But what you WILL need is the intuition about:\n",
    "  - Why training loops work the way they do\n",
    "  - How data flows through models\n",
    "  - Why certain architectures solve certain problems\n",
    "\n",
    "  Our simplified framework teaches these patterns clearly. Once you understand them here, you can recognize them in ANY framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### ✅ ENCOURAGED: AI as Your Learning Partner\n",
    "  Use AI tools to:\n",
    "  - **Understand concepts**: \"Why do we normalize images before feeding them to CNNs?\"\n",
    "  - **Debug errors**: \"Why am I getting a dimension mismatch in my forward pass?\"\n",
    "  - **Connect ideas**: \"How does the approach in this lesson relate to what PyTorch Lightning does?\"\n",
    "  - **Explore documentation**: \"What parameters does timm's create_model accept?\"\n",
    "  - **Review understanding**: \"Can you trace through what happens in this training loop?\"\n",
    "  - **When specifically instructed**: Some assignments explicitly ask you to use AI (e.g., adapting pretrained models)\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### ❌ NOT ACCEPTABLE: Bypassing the Learning Process\n",
    "  Do NOT use AI to:\n",
    "  - Copy-paste homework questions to generate complete solutions\n",
    "  - Generate code without understanding what it does\n",
    "  - Submit solutions using completely different approaches than the lesson\n",
    "  - Skip the thinking process of breaking down problems\n",
    "  - Write your responses to questions that require text answers\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### EXCEPTION: When We Tell You To\n",
    "  Some assignments specifically instruct you to use AI (like adapting torchvision or timm models for transfer learning). In these cases:\n",
    "  - Follow the specific instructions given\n",
    "  - Still understand what the generated code does\n",
    "  - Be able to explain your modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Why This Distinction Matters\n",
    "  **Good approach**: Work through the lesson approach first, understand it, THEN ask AI: \"How would this same pattern look in PyTorch Lightning?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Bad approach**: Skip the lesson and ask AI: \"Write me a CNN for FashionMNIST\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### The Professional Reality\n",
    "  When you move to industry or research:\n",
    "  - You'll inherit existing codebases using specific patterns\n",
    "  - You'll need to debug models when they don't converge\n",
    "  - You'll adapt existing architectures to new problems\n",
    "  - You'll need to explain why your model makes certain predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "  These skills only come from understanding the \"why\" behind the code, not just having code that runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### What Happens When You Submit AI-Generated Solutions\n",
    "  If your code uses notably different patterns than our lessons (without being instructed to):\n",
    "  - **Score: 0 points** - because it shows you haven't engaged with the material\n",
    "  - We can tell: Different import patterns, unfamiliar utilities, advanced techniques we haven't covered, or solutions that skip our demonstrated approach\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Think of It Like Learning Music\n",
    "  You could have AI generate a song, but you wouldn't learn to play guitar. You could have AI write about music theory, but you wouldn't understand harmony. The exercises in this course are your \"scales and chords\"—they build the foundation for creative work later.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Moving Forward\n",
    "  After this course, you'll likely use:\n",
    "  - **PyTorch Lightning** for cleaner training loops\n",
    "  - **HuggingFace** for transformer models\n",
    "  - **timm** or **torchvision** for computer vision architectures\n",
    "  - **Weights & Biases** for experiment tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "  But you'll understand WHY these tools make the choices they do, because you've built the patterns from scratch."
