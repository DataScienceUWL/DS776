The actual locations depend on your environment:\n\n| Variable | CoCalc Home Server | Compute Server |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|\n| `MODELS_PATH` | `Homework_02_Models/` | `Homework_02_Models/` *(synced)* |\n| `DATA_PATH` | `~/home_workspace/data/` | `~/cs_workspace/data/` *(local)* |\n| `CACHE_PATH` | `~/home_workspace/downloads/` | `~/cs_workspace/downloads/` *(local)* |\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- On **Compute Servers**: Only `MODELS_PATH` syncs back to CoCalc (~10GB limit). Data and cache stay local (~50GB).\n- On **CoCalc Home**: Everything syncs and counts against the ~10GB limit.\n- **Storage_Cleanup.ipynb** (in this folder) helps free synced space when needed.\n\n**Tip:** Always write `MODELS_PATH / 'model.pt'` \u2014 never hardcode paths like `'Homework_02_Models/model.pt'`.",
