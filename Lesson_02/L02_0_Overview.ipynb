    "2. **Design and implement basic CNN architectures** in PyTorch, including convolutional layers, pooling, and activation functions.\n",
    "3. **Understand how padding, stride, kernel size, and the number of output channels** interact to determine the dimensionality of the output in each convolutional layer.\n",
    "4. **Apply data augmentation techniques** to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting in image classification tasks.\n",
    "5. **Experiment with and assess the impact of pooling layers**, such as max-pooling, on the robustness and efficiency of CNN models. \n"
