# VS Code Voice/Speech Setup Status
**Date:** 2025-08-20

## Current Issue
VS Code Speech extension (ms-vscode.vscode-speech) installed but voice dictation keybinding not working on Windows machine accessed via RDP with Mac keyboard.

## What Works
✅ Voice dictation works when launched from Command Palette ("Terminal: Start Dictation in Terminal")
✅ Microphone works in Windows (verified with Sound Recorder)
✅ VS Code has microphone permissions in Windows

## What Doesn't Work
❌ Keybinding shortcuts not triggering voice dictation

## Troubleshooting Completed
1. **Fixed PyTorch CUDA issue** (separate issue - RTX 5090 support)
   - Installed PyTorch nightly build 2.9.0.dev20250819+cu128

2. **Identified correct command names from extension docs:**
   - `workbench.action.editorDictation.start` (NOT the terminal/voice commands we tried initially)
   - `workbench.action.editorDictation.stop`
   - `workbench.action.chat.startVoiceChat` (for chat/Copilot)

3. **Current keybinding configuration** (`~/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json`):
   ```json
   {
       "key": "ctrl+alt+v",
       "command": "workbench.action.terminal.startVoice",
       "when": "(hasSpeechProvider && terminalHasBeenCreated || hasSpeechProvider && terminalProcessSupported) && !terminalVoiceInProgress"
   },
   {
       "key": "ctrl+alt+v",
       "command": "workbench.action.terminal.stopVoice",
       "when": "(hasSpeechProvider && terminalHasBeenCreated || hasSpeechProvider && terminalProcessSupported) && terminalVoiceInProgress"
   }
   ```
   - Same key (Ctrl+Alt+V) toggles between start/stop based on voice state

## Diagnostic Info
- Keyboard shortcuts troubleshooting shows F4/Alt+V being received but "no when clauses matched" or "no keybinding entries"
- Mac keyboard on Windows via RDP (Alt key = Option key)
- Developer Tools accessed via F12 (Ctrl+Shift+I is taken by GitHub Copilot)

## Next Steps
1. **Full restart of VS Code** (not just reload window) - pending
2. Test Ctrl+Alt+V keybinding after restart for terminal voice input
3. If still not working, may need to:
   - Check if keybindings.json is in correct location for Windows
   - Try alternative speech extensions (whisper-based)
   - Verify extension is loading properly in Developer Tools console

## Alternative Commands to Test
If keybinding still fails, these commands work from Command Palette:
- "Terminal: Start Dictation in Terminal" ✅ (confirmed working)
- "Editor: Start Dictation"
- "Chat: Start Voice Chat"

## Files Modified
- `/home/jbaggett/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json` - Added voice dictation keybindings
- PyTorch updated to nightly build for RTX 5090 support
