Fine-grained classification is when you have many categories or classes that are similar like related species of flowers. Or, for example, trying to distinguish breeds of dogs as opposed to cats, dogs, and foxes.\n\nNote: we were able to train all the models described in this homework in about 40 minutes on the T4 Compute Server. The ConvNeXt model was the biggest and took the most time."

Data and cache stay local (~50GB).\n- On **CoCalc Home**: Everything syncs and counts against the ~10GB limit.\n- **Storage_Cleanup.ipynb** (in this folder) helps free synced space when needed.\n\n**Tip:** Always write `MODELS_PATH / 'model.pt'` — never hardcode paths like `'Homework_05_Models/model.pt'`.",

It should have methods to freeze and unfreeze the backbone. Apply transfer learning instantiating your model with the default Imagenet weights and training with for 5 epochs followed by training for a suitable number of epochs (you may need to experiment). Include graphics or display dataframes to show how the model is converging (at least for the unfrozen training).\n\nUse the training and validation sets here. The test set will be reserved for your final best model.\n\nWhat kind of validation accuracy are you able to achieve? Is the model overfitting?\n\nNote: the training dataset is already pretty small so downsampling it to expedite experimentation isn't a good idea, but you could temporarily reduce the size of the images to say 128x128 in your transforms to get things working, then go back to 224x224 to train your models.

Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which use convolutional layers to capture spatial hierarchies, ViTs divide images into patches and process them as sequences, allowing for global context understanding. ViTs typically require more data to train from scratch compared to CNNs, but they can be effectively used for transfer learning on smaller datasets if the images are similar to those in the Imagenet dataset. We'll learn more about transformer models in the second half of the course.\n\nLoad the pre-trained ViT Small model from the timm library with:\n```python\nimport timm\nmodel = timm.create_model('vit_small_patch16_224', pretrained=True)\n```\n\nThe ViT Small model is pretrained on Imagenet and expects the same size images and same normalization as other models. Typically we fine tune the whole model and don't train with a frozen backbone. The learning rates used are usually smaller, too. Do the same kind of fine tuning as you've done above using OneCycleLR with max_lr = 0.0005. We found that the number of epochs needed was similar to the total number of epochs used in the two-phase training used by our other models."
