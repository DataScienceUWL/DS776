Fine-grained classification is when you have many categories or classes that are similar like related species of flowers. Or, for example, trying to distinguish breeds of dogs as opposed to cats, dogs, and foxes.\n\nNote: we were able to train all the models described in this homework in about 40 minutes on the T4 Compute Server.

   "source": "## [5 pts] ViT Small\n\nVision Transformers (ViTs) are a type of neural network architecture that leverages the transformer model, originally designed for natural language processing, to process image data. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which use convolutional layers to capture spatial hierarchies, ViTs divide images into patches and process them as sequences, allowing for global context understanding. ViTs typically require more data to train from scratch compared to CNNs, but they can be effectively used for transfer learning on smaller datasets if the images are similar to those in the Imagenet dataset. We'll learn more about transformer models in the second half of the course.\n\nWe'll use the timm library which doesn't seem to be installed in CoCalc.\nTo use ViT Small from the timm library, you can install timm with the following command:\n```python\n!pip install timm\n```\nThen, load the pre-trained ViT Small model with:\n```python\nimport timm\nmodel = timm.create_model('vit_small_patch16_224', pretrained=True)\n```\n\n(Note: you'll need to copy this code from this markdown cell to a regular code cell for the installation to work correctly.)\n\nThe ViT Small model is pretrained on Imagenet and expects the same size images and same normalization as other models. Typically we fine tune the whole model and don't train with a frozen backbone. The learning rates used are usually smaller, too. Do the same kind of fine tuning as you've done above using OneCycleLR with max_lr = 0.0005. We found that the number of epochs needed was similar to the total number of epochs used in the two-phase training used by our other models."

What structural similarities make this possible?\n- According to the reading, what are the two critical factors that determine transfer learning success: dataset size and what other factor?\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **YOUR ANSWER HERE:**\n\n**Question 2 (3 pts):** Section 13.2 compares warm start vs frozen weight approaches. From your implementation above and the reading:\n- Explain the difference between \"warm start\" and \"frozen weights\" approaches in transfer learning. What parameters change in each method?\n- According to Figure 13.5 and the discussion, when should you prefer frozen weights over warm start? What advantage does frozen weights provide with limited data?\n- In your experiments above, how did the performance compare between different transfer learning approaches? Does this match the textbook's predictions?\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **YOUR ANSWER HERE:**\n\n**Question 3 (2 pts):** Section 13.3 discusses the relationship between dataset size, number of parameters, and model performance:\n- The reading presents a simplified equation: \u03b8 = \u03b8* + \u03b5\u22c5D/N. Explain what this equation means in practical terms for model training.\n- How does freezing weights effectively reduce the \"D\" term in this equation, and why does this help when you have limited training data?\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **YOUR ANSWER HERE:**",
