Please answer the following questions:\n\n### [2 pts] Question 1: Assignment Deadlines and Late Policy\nBased on the syllabus, when are assignments due each week? What is the penalty for submitting an assignment on Wednesday versus Thursday? What happens if you submit after Thursday's deadline?\n\n📝 **YOUR ANSWER HERE:**\n\n### [2 pts] Question 2: AI Use Policy Summary\nIn your own words, summarize the course's AI use policy. Include:\n- Two specific examples of ENCOURAGED uses of AI in this course\n- Two specific examples of PROHIBITED uses that would result in 0 points\n- Why does the course have this policy (what skills are we trying to develop)?\n\n📝 **YOUR ANSWER HERE:**\n\n### [2 pts] Question 3: Getting Help\nAccording to the syllabus, what is the primary way you should communicate with the instructor for course-related questions?

Experiment with the network structure and try retraining each network a few times until you find a network architecture that seems to work reasonably well.  Once you've done that you should implement that network here in PyTorch.  \n",
